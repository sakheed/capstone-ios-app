# Signal Q iOS App 
**Team:** Sakhee Desai, Aman Singh, Benita Abraham, Charmaine Pasicolan, Alexander Hoy

---

## Project Brief: 
**SignalQ** is a SwiftUI-based iOS app designed to record low latency audio and detect gunshots using a CoreML machine learning classifier model. Upon detection, it records data from multiple sensors including GPS, heart rate, gyroscope, and pressure. All data is saved locally with Realm and then uploaded to a backend using gRPC.

## Requirements and Cloning the Repo 
[need to add here]

---

## üìÇ Key Components and File Responsibilities

### `CAPSTONEApp.swift`
- App entry point.
- Generates a unique Realm database per app launch to avoid conflicts.
- Injects `DetectionDataStore` into the environment for app-wide use.

---

### `ContentView.swift`
- **Navigation & Screens**:
  - Displays splash screen, landing page, and detection interface.
- **LandingPage**:
  - Contains brand visuals, website link, QR registration, and activation.
- **DetectionScreen**:
  - Displays real-time sensor data.
  - Records are created upon notification from audio classifier.
  - Allows export of audio (WAV ZIP) and sensor logs (CSV).
  - Upload functionality to remote server via gRPC.

#### üîë Key Functions:
- `saveToRealm(record:)`: Saves event data to Realm and triggers `sendToServer`
- `sendToServer(records:)`: Converts Realm record data to proto and uploads.
- `exportCSV()`, `exportData(type:)`: Exports collected data.
- `retryFailedUploads()`: Retries uploads for failed records.

---

### `AudioRecorder.swift`
- Core engine to manage audio analysis and recording.
- Uses AudioKit and Apple SoundAnalysis framework.
- Maintains a rolling buffer to capture pre/post-trigger audio.
- See DOCUMENTATION folder for details on how to create and train a CoreML model within XCode. 

#### üîë Key Functions:
- `startRecording()` / `stopRecording()`: Manage AudioKit engine.
- `storeAudioBuffer(_:)`: Updates rolling buffer, detects trigger, stores data.
- `analyzeAudio(_:)`: Runs sound classification.
- `saveGunshotClip(buffers:)`: Writes `.caf` audio file and triggers `NotificationCenter`.

#### üîÑ Process Flow:
1. Audio stream starts.
2. Buffer sent to CoreML classifier.
3. If gunshot confidence > 0.8, record is triggered.
4. Pre/post audio segments combined and saved.
5. A notification is posted to initiate full sensor data capture.

---

### `QRScannerView.swift`
- QR code scanner built with `AVFoundation`.
- Supports automatic URL open and scanning feedback.

#### üîë Key Functions:
- `makeUIViewController(context:)`: Camera setup.
- `metadataOutput(_:didOutput:)`: QR code detection and handling.

---

## üß™ Sensor Managers
- `LocationManager`
- `HeartRateManager.swift`
- `OrientationManager.swift`
- `PressureManager.swift`
- `GyroscopeManager.swift`

Each of these uses `@Published` properties to expose live data to the UI.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Uploading and Server Integration
This project implements a Python-based gRPC client and server for sending structured detection messages, including location and sensor data (e.g., gunshot detections), over the network using Protocol Buffers.

### `proto-repo/proto/detection.proto`
- Defines a Detection service that sends a `DetectionMessage` and and returns an `Acknowledgement` message
- `Acknowledgement`: either `true` for Ack or `false` for Nack and a reason for failure, if applicable
- `DetectionMessage`: contains all time, location, sensor and classification data for each detection the detection 
- The service can one or more detections at once

### `proto-repo/server/server.py`
- Server listens for incoming Detection messages and responds with Acknowledgement true
- Starts the server on port 50051

### `GRPClient.swift`
- Client side code with GRPCClient
- `runClient(detections: Signalq_Detections)`: Takes a detection record and sets up target host (127.0.0.1) and port (50051). **Note**: target host should be the IP address of the phone used for testing.
- `sendDetection(using detectionService: Signalq_DetectionService.ClientProtocol, detections: Signalq_Detections)`: calls the gRPC method in the generated swift files using ClientProtocol; prints the response from the server

---

## üì§ Export Features
- **WAV ZIP Export**: Packs all `gunshot_*.caf` audio clips into a `audioClips.zip` archive.
- **CSV Export**: Exports sensor metadata in human-readable format.
- Accessible through the UI menu on the Detection screen.
